/* INSTRUCTIONS
In this codeQuiz, you'll concatenate strings together using the '+'
operator. This allows us to easily combine strings with other types
of values, without having to rewrite or recreate them.

 1) create a variable named myName that stores your name as a string
 2) On the next line, create a variable named greeting1 that stores
    the string “Hello my name is”.
 3) Next, create a varaible named greeting2 that stores the string
    “Nice to meet you”.
 4) Use concatenate to combine greeting1, myname, and greeting2.
    Save this concatenation to a variable named myGreeting.
 5) Log myGreeting to the console.

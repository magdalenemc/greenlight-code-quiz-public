/* ***INSTRUCIONS***

Storing our values as variables is extremely useful - especially when
the goal of our program is to create a mathematical equation. In this
case, we'll be using variables and numeric data to calculate an
average of grades.

  1) Create a variable named testGrade and set it to equal to 84
  2) Create a variable named quizGrade and set it equal to 90
  3) create a variable named homeworkGrade and set it equal to 75
  4) Create an expression that adds the three grades together and
    divides the result by three. Save it to a variable named
    'classAverage'.
  6) log the result of that expression to the console

  A quick example some similar code has been provided below. Make
  sure to begin your code after "Your code here".

*/

//examples
// var grade1 = 82;
// var grade2 = 98;
// var avg = (grade1 + grade2) / 2;

// Your code here:
var testGrade = 84;
var quizGrade = 90;
var homeworkGrade = 75;

var classAverage = (testGrade + quizGrade + homeworkGrade)/3;
console.log(classAverage);

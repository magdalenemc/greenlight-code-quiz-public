/*
In the previous exercise we used arithmetic operators to create (very simple) mathematical equations.
These expressions gave us back a numeric value as a result.

Another type of operator you might be familiar with are comparison operators.
Used with two values, called operands, comparison operators don’t return a numeric value as a result.
Comparison operators give back a boolean - true or false value!

Comparison Operators include:
Greater than/Greater than or Equal to (> / >=)
Less than/Less than or Equal to (< / <= )
Equal to ( === )
Not Equal to ( != )

For example, the expression 4 <=  5 evaluates to true because four is indeed less than five.
However, the expression 4 >= 5 evaluates to false because four is neither greater than or equal to 5.

Where the code editor says ‘your code here’ :
1) Write a console.log statement that compares the values of two numbers using either > or >= that evaluates to true
2) Write a second console.log statement that compares the values of two numbers using either < or <= that evaluates to true
3) Write a third console.log statement that compares the values of two numbers using === that evaluates to false
4) Write a final console.log statement that compares the values of two numbers using != that evaluates to false
Some examples are provided below.

Make sure to place your console.log statement ONLY where it says ‘your code here’ and before the final curly brace and semicolon ‘ };
*/

//example
console.log(4 >= 5); //returns false
console.log(4 <= 5); //returns true

const logOperators = () => {
  // Your code here:
};

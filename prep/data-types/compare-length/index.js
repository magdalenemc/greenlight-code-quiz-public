Instructions:

In the previous code quiz we used the .length() property to calculate the length of a few strings.
Since .length() gives us back a number value, we can use comparison operators to compare the
length of two strings to determine which is longer or shorter.

Where the code editor says ‘your code here’ :
1) Write a console.log statement that determines the length of the string “coding”
   and then determines if it is greater than or equal to 2.
2) Write a console.log statement that determines the length of the string “coding”
   and then determines whether or not it is less than or equal to the length of the string “Programming”
3) Write a console.log statement that determines the length of the string
   “Spark” and then determines if it is equal to 5.

Examples have been provided below. Make sure to place your console.log statement
ONLY where it says ‘your code here’ and before the final curly brace and semicolon ‘ };

//examples
console.log("Mary".length >= 2);
console.log("Susuan".length >= "Mary".length);

const logCompare = () => {
  // Your code here:

};

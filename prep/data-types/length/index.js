Instructions:

.length() is a property in JavaScript that we can use with a String value
that will give us the number of characters (i.e. letters, numbers, symbols, etc) in a string!

You can simply attach .length() to any string value, and the result we’ll get is a number of how long the string is.
For instance, in the string ‘Selina’ there are 6 characters. ‘Selina’.length() will return the number
6 - which is the length of the string.

Let’s use .length() on some strings!
Where the code editor says ‘your code here’ :

1) Write a console.log statement that will calculate the length of the string ‘HalleBot’ using .length()
2) Write a second console.log statement that will calculate the length of the string “Maddy and Selina are hungry!"

Some examples are provided below.

 Make sure to place your console.log statement ONLY where it says ‘your code here’
 and before the final curly brace and semicolon ‘ };

//example
console.log("myString".length);
console.log("This is an even longer string!!".length);

// Your code here:

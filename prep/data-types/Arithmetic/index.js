INSTRUCTIONS
Let’s do some math with our number data type!

We can create simple math expressions by using Arithmetic Operators
for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).
Numeric data also consists of negative integers (i.e. -5, -2)
and decimals (i.e. 0.32233, 1.5) within the number data type.

1) Write a console.log statement that prints the result of 2 + 2 to the console.
2) Write a second console.log statement that prints the result of 10.5 - 9.2 to the console
3) Write a third console.log statement that prints the result of -3 / 2 to the console
4) Write a final console.log statement that prints the result of 5.2 * 4 to  the console

Make sure to use a semicolon after every console.log statement!
Lastly, make sure to begin your code ONLY where it says ‘your code here’
and before the final  curly brace and semicolon ‘ }; ’

//example: uncomment the line below to view them in the console.
// console.log(1 + 1);
// console.log(2 * 4);

const logArithmetic = () => {
  // Your code here:

};

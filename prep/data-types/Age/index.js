/*
Instructions:
Remember, numeric data is considered part of the Number data type in JavaScript.
Lets create a number and log it to the console!

Where the code editor says ‘your code here’ :
1) Write a console.log statement that will print your age to the console.

Where the line of code reads 'const myAge = "FILL_ME_IN"' , replace "FILL_ME_IN" with the number
value of your age.

An example has been provided below.
Make sure to place your console.log statement ONLY where it says ‘your code here’
and before the final curly brace and semicolon ‘ };

*/


// example:
// console.log(19); //uncomment to see this logged to your console

const logAge = (myAge) => {


//Your code here:


};

// Put your age below as a number
const myAge = "FILL_ME_IN";

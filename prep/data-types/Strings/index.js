/*
In our module we learned about the string data type and how to create them in our code.
You can create strings using single quoutes ‘ ‘ and double quotes “ “ .
Lets practice creating some strings below!

Where the code editor says ‘your code here’ :
1) Write a console.log statement that will print the string Hello World! To the console. Create this string using single quotes.
2) Write another console.log statement that will print any string of your choice to the console. Create this string using double quotes.
3) Write a third console.log statement that will print a string of numbers to the console (i.e. 23232). Create this string using single quotes
4) Write a fourth console.log statement that will print an empty string to the console using either single or double quotes.
5) Some examples have been provided below.

 Make sure to place your console.log statement ONLY where it says ‘your code here’
 and before the final curly brace and semicolon ‘ };

//examples
console.log('Hello');
console.log(" ");

// Your code here:

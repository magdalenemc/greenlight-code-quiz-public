/*
Another arithmetic operator that we haven’t seen or used yet is modulo ‘%’.
We don’t use this to calculate percentages in JavaScript (even though it is the sign that is usually associated with percent).
When used with two values, modulo gives us back the remainder after dividing those two values.

For example, ‘ 2 % 2 ‘ would give us back the answer 0 because after dividing 2 by 2 there is no remainder.
Wheras ‘ 5 % 2 ‘ would give us back the answer 1 because 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1.

Lets practice using modulo !
Where the code editor says ‘your code here’ :
1) Write a console.log statement that will print to the console the result of 4 % 2
2) Write another console.log statement that will print to the console the result of 3 % 2.

Some examples are provided below.
 Make sure to place your console.log statement ONLY where it says ‘your code here’ and before the final curly brace and semicolon ‘ };

//example
console.log(2 % 2);

// Your code here:
